# NVIDIA Launchables 🚀

[Console](https://console.brev.dev) • [Docs](https://brev.dev) • [Launchables](/nvidia-kejones/launchables) • [Discord](https://discord.gg/NVDyv7TUgJ)

This repository contains a collection of NVIDIA Launchables - one-click deployable GPU development environments for various AI and machine learning topics. Each Launchable has been configured with the minimum GPU requirements and comes with a deploy button for instant access.

**Launchables are GPU environments with predefined configurations that help you get up and running quickly. They can contain:**
- Specific NVIDIA GPU resources (T4 to H100)
- Pre-configured Docker containers
- GPU-accelerated tools and frameworks
- Jupyter notebooks and examples

We welcome contributions to this repository! If you have a Launchable you'd like to add, please reach out via [Discord](https://discord.gg/NVDyv7TUgJ) or open a pull request!
