This repository contains a collection of Launchables - one-click deployable GPU development environments for various AI and machine learning topics. Each Launchable has been configured with the minimum GPU requirements and comes with a deploy button for instant access.

**Launchables are GPU environments with predefined configurations that help you get up and running quickly. They can contain:**
- Specific NVIDIA GPU resources (T4 to H100)
- Pre-configured Docker containers
- GPU-accelerated tools and frameworks
- Jupyter notebooks and examples
